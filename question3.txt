Question 3 

If I remove #include <stdio.h> from a program that calls printf, the compiler no longer
knows the proper declaration for printf. This would then cause a problem in the compiling stage as it doesn't know what it's working on.

The compiler will usually give a message like:
“warning: implicit declaration of function ‘printf’” or
“error: ‘printf’ undeclared (first use in this function)”.

So the program fails at the compilation stage because printf is defined in the stdio.h
header file and the compiler cannot find its declaration. Which is why it's crucial to have it as it's what keeps the compiling stage working.
