Question 2 – How a C Program Becomes an Executable

1) Preprocessing  
   This is the stage where all #include and #define statements get taken care of.  
   Header files are pulled in and macros are expanded to prepare the code for the compiler.  
   Possible error: using #include for a file that doesn’t exist.

2) Compilation  
   The compiler checks the C code for mistakes and converts it into assembly code.  
   This is where syntax errors, type errors, or missing semicolons show up.  
   Possible error: undeclared variables or incorrect syntax.

3) Assembly  
   The assembly code produced by the compiler is turned into machine code inside an object file.  
   This step is simple and easy with a lot less detail involved. 
   Possible error: corrupted assembly output or invalid instruction formats.

4) Linking  
   The linker combines your object file with required libraries (like printf from stdio).  
   It makes one final executable program.  
   Possible error: “undefined reference” when a function is used but not found.

5) Loading  
   The operating system loads the executable into memory and prepares it to run main().  
   This is the last step before your program starts.  
   Possible error: file permission issues or the executable not being found.
