Question 12 – Operator Precedence Problem

The code used: res = a + b << 1;
The problem is that the << operator has higher precedence than +.
So the expression is evaluated as: a + (b << 1)

This is not what the writer of the code was expecting. They thought it'd just go in order of left to right which would be 
(a + b) << 1.

There's two correct ways the writer could fix it:

1) Use parentheses:
   res = (a + b) << 1;

2) Use normal arithmetic instead of bit shifting:
   res = (a + b) * 2;
